	<h1>Typography</h1>
      </section>
      <section class="body">
	<p>The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how
the body text looks. Why? Because there’s more body text than anything
else. So start every project by making the body text look good, then
worry about the&nbsp;rest.</p>
<div class="include-media-test"></div>

<p>In turn, the appearance of the body text is determined primarily
by these four typographic&nbsp;choices:</p>
<p>point size is the size of the letters. In print, the most comfortable
range for body text is 10–12 point. On the web, the range is 15–25
pixels. Not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so
be prepared to adjust as&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>20px;</p>
<p>line spacing is the vertical distance between lines. It should be
120–145% of the point size. In word processors, use the “Exact”
line-spacing option to achieve this. The default single-line
option is too tight; the 1½-line option is too loose. In <span class="caps">CSS</span>, use&nbsp;line-height.</p>
<p>1.45</p>
<p>line length is the horizontal width of the text block. Line length
should be an average of 45–90 characters per line (use your
word-count function) or 2–3 lowercase alphabets, like&nbsp;so:</p>
<p><span class="alphabet odd">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</span><span class="alphabet even">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</span><span class="alphabet odd">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</span></p>
<p>In a printed document, this usually means page margins larger than
the traditional one inch. On a web page, it usually means not
allowing the text to flow to the edges of the browser&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>And finally, font choice. The fastest, easiest, and most visible
improvement you can make to your typography is to ignore the
fonts that came free with your computer (known as system fonts) and
buy a professional font (like my fonts equity and concourse, or
others found in font recommendations). A professional font
gives you the benefit of a professional designer’s skills
without having to hire&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Publico&nbsp;Text</p>
<p>If that’s impossible, you can still make good typography with
system fonts. But choose wisely. And never choose times new roman or
Arial, as those fonts are favored only by the apathetic and
sloppy. Not by typographers. Not by&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>That’s it. As you put these five rules to work, you’ll notice your
documents starting to look more like professionally published&nbsp;material.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, if you’re ready for a little more, try the summary of key&nbsp;rules.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for a lot more, start at the foreword and keep&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>Curly quotation&nbsp;marks:</p>
<p>typogrify</p>
<p>One space between sentences. So&nbsp;nice.</p>
<p>Underline. I&#8217;m not even doing it for hyperlinks, not sure how I feel
about&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Kerning is&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>text-rendering:&nbsp;optimizeLegibility;</p>
<p>Not using justified&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>Using real characters (em dash,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>Ty­pog­ra­phy is for the ben­e­fit of the reader, not the writer.&nbsp;http://practicaltypography.com/who-is-typography-for.html</p>
<p>Divide the page into foreground and background. Body text should be
the foreground. Imitate what you like :)&nbsp;http://practicaltypography.com/maxims-of-page-layout.html</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use huge point sizes for headings.&nbsp;http://practicaltypography.com/websites.html</p>
