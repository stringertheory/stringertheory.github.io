      	To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not
      	exactly novel. We've got it down to four words: &ldquo;Do what you
      	love.&rdquo; But it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing
      	what you love is complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
      	The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as
      	kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were
      	opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time
      	adults were making you do things, and that was called work;
      	the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that
      	was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do
      	were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn'tâ€”for example,
      	if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few
      	anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as
      	not-fun.</p>
      <p>
      	And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied,
      	was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.
      </p>
      <p>
      	The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and
      	kids. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to
      	work. Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which
      	was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real
      	thing. Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed
      	that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.
