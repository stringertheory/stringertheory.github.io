	<!-- 	To do <a href="">something well</a> you have to like it. That idea is not -->
	<!-- 	exactly novel. We've got it down to four words: &ldquo;Do what you -->
	<!-- 	love.&rdquo; But it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing -->
	<!-- 	what you love is complicated. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> -->
	<!-- 	The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as -->
	<!-- 	kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were -->
	<!-- 	opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time -->
	<!-- 	adults were making you do things, and that was called work; -->
	<!-- 	the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that -->
	<!-- 	was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do -->
	<!-- 	were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn'tâ€”for example, -->
	<!-- 	if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few -->
	<!-- 	anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as -->
	<!-- 	not-fun.</p> -->
	<!-- <p> -->
	<!-- 	And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, -->
	<!-- 	was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work. -->

	  Congratulations for finding this site! I am not sure what I
	  am going to write about here, if anything. Right now, I've
	  been using it to mess around with typography and Github
	  pages.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Some things I might write about include:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Making a SketchUp model of my home to help with painting
	      and furniture choices.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Why does anybody have kids?
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      What I love about Chicago.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      What I like about Uptown in Chicago.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      My robotics projects of yore.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Drawing.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  We'll see how that all pans out.
